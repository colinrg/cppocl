#C++ Unit Test Framework

![](header_image.jpg)

This unit test framework provides a variety of features in a single library, including:
* Testing for success with CHECK_TRUE, CHECK_EQUAL, etc.
* Identify tests as functions, member functions and const member functions.
* Pass or fail a test based on the performance.
* Fixtures (setup and teardown).
* Fail on memory leak.
* Single header file include for all features.
* Override test output for function names and arguments.
* Provide custom logging (replace stdio output).
* Test for C++ exceptions.
